			<h1 class="about">About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Nicolas Ramkay. I am a second-year programming student at Seneca@York. I'm studying in the hopes of finding a stable and reliable line of work. I have always enjoyed
                working around and with computers. It took me many years to finally come to the realization that this was what I wanted to do. I'm glad I made this decision and look forward to
                a bright and prosperous career in programming.

            <h3>Courses</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
                The courses I am enrolled in span the gap between database languages like SQL all the way to insane memory management with C++.
            </p>
            <p>
                INT222 is my second attempt to complete this course. I dropped it over the summer semester in order to concentrate on my primary focus: Programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                OOP344 is the third level of computer programming and so far it is KICKING MY BUTT! It is very difficult and yet still incredibly rewarding. Know your link lists!!!
            </p>
            <p>
                IBC233 is easily my least favorite technical course. We are working together with the IBM i-series server/workstation and honestly WHO CARES?!?!
            </p>
            <p>
                PSY666 I hate electives. I'm tired of bullshitting essays and arguments. I'd rather program.
            </p>
            <p>
                DBS301 is my favorite. SQL is a language that I could get used to doing rather often. I am aprehensive in going whole hog into specialization because I know that C++ or Java could be
                much more powerful.
            </p>
